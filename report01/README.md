# Problem

- With reference to the following, calibrate your PC's camera or external web camera, and prepare a report (about 4 pages of A4 paper) with a brief summary of the principle of calibration, input images, calibration results, image distortion correction results, and a discussion.
  - https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenCV-3-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Cookbook (Chapter09)
  - https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html
  - https://learnopencv.com/camera-calibration-using-opencv/
- However, any programming language may be used.

- The report must be submitted in pdf format. 
- A cover sheet is not required (if you have one, it will not be included in the number of pages of the report), but your student ID number and name must be clearly written at the beginning of the report.
